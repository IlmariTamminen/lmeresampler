Below are the functions that need to be implemented

* `boot`
* `boot.parametric`
* `boot.residual`
* `boot.case`
* `boot.cgr`
* `boot.reb` will be the generalized REB function.
* `boot.reb1` will take care of REB/1 before bootstrapping.
* `boot.reb2` will take care of REB/2 after bootstrapping.
* `model.generator` will take care of generating bootstrap samples from the model.
* `estimates` will compute estimates for all parameters of two-level models
