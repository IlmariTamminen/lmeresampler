Below are the functions that need to be implemented:

* `boot`
* `boot.parametric`
* `boot.residual`
* `boot.case`
* `boot.cgr`
* `boot.reb(residuals, type=(0,1,2))` will be the generalized REB function where it is passed a vector of residuals and the type of Bootstrap we want. `type=0` is REB, `type=1` is REB/1, and `type=2` is REB/2.
* `boot.reb1(residuals)` will take care of REB/1 before bootstrapping. It should be passed a vector of residuals.
* `boot.reb2(bootstrap)` will take care of REB/2 after bootstrapping. It should be passed the results from `boot.reb`.
* `simulate(model, parameters)` will take care of generating bootstrap samples from the model which is passed in and a vector of parameters.
* `estimate` will compute estimates for all parameters of two-level models
