  New submission
  Package was archived on CRAN


  Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    CGR (8:40)
    REB (9:12)

  CRAN repository db overrides:
    X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2019-03-01 as check problems were not
      corrected in time.
  
CGR and REB are not misspelled, they are acronyms. This is a new submission since the package was archived. This update corrects the old issues and makes some improvements in the documentation.
